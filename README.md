# USAS-Evaluation-Framework

Evaluation metrics and datasets for USAS Semantic Tagging


## Setup

You can either use the dev container with your favourite editor, e.g. VSCode. Or you can create your setup locally below we demonstrate both.

In both cases they share the same tools, of which these tools are:
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python packaging and development
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (OPTIONAL) for automation of tasks, not strictly required but makes life easier.

### Dev Container

A [dev container](https://containers.dev/) uses a docker container to create the required development environment, the Dockerfile we use for this dev container can be found at [./.devcontainer/Dockerfile](./.devcontainer/Dockerfile). To run it locally it requires docker to be installed, you can also run it in a cloud based code editor, for a list of supported editors/cloud editors see [the following webpage.](https://containers.dev/supporting)

To run for the first time on a local VSCode editor (a slightly more detailed and better guide on the [VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial)):
1. Ensure docker is running.
2. Ensure the VSCode [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension is installed in your VSCode editor.
3. Open the command pallete `CMD + SHIFT + P` and then select `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`

You should now have everything you need to develop, `uv`, `make`, for VSCode various extensions like `Pylance`, etc.

If you have any trouble see the [VSCode website.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial).

### Local

To run locally first ensure you have the following tools installted locally:
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for Python packaging and development. (version `0.9.6`)
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (OPTIONAL) for automation of tasks, not strictly required but makes life easier.
  * Ubuntu: `apt-get install make`
  * Mac: [Xcode command line tools](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/4) includes `make` else you can use [brew.](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make)
  * Windows: Various solutions proposed in this [blog post](https://earthly.dev/blog/makefiles-on-windows/) on how to install on Windows, inclduing `Cygwin`, and `Windows Subsystem for Linux`.

When developing on the project you will want to install the Python package locally in editable format with all the extra requirements, this can be done like so:

```bash
uv sync
```

### Linting

Linting and formatting with [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) it is a replacement for tools like Flake8, isort, Black etc, and we us [ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) for type checking.

To run the linting:

``` bash
make lint
```

### Tests

To run the tests (uses pytest and coverage) and generate a coverage report:

``` bash
make test
```
